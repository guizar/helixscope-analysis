# Helix-scope Analysis

This project is intended to support the data processing component of Vizzualityâ€™s [HELIX project](https://github.com/Vizzuality/helix-scope)

The data science environment and tools are based on Vizzuality's Data Science [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Vizzuality/data_sci_tutorials)

To launch the programming environment, start docker via:
```bash
./jupyter.sh develop
```
Then open a browser to `0.0.0.0:8888` to connect to the Jupyter server.

Notebooks and data for this repo are stored in `./Work`.
